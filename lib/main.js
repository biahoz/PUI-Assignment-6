        "3. First, one must determine precisely “what-and-what do I wish to say and present,” before you may write. Writing must be mimicry.",
        "4. Since the writer lacks many of the speaker’s means, he must in general have for his model a very expressive kind of presentation of necessity, the written copy will appear much paler.",
        "5. The richness of life reveals itself through a richness of gestures. One must learn to feel everything — the length and retarding of sentences, inter-punctuations, the choice of words, the pausing, the sequence of arguments — like gestures.",
        "6. Be careful with periods! Only those people who also have long duration of breath while speaking are entitled to periods. With most people, the period is a matter of affectation.",
        "7. Style ought to prove that one believes in an idea; not only that one thinks it but also feels it.",
        "8. The more abstract a truth which one wishes to teach, the more one must first entice the senses.",
        "9. Strategy on the part of the good writer of prose consists of choosing his means for stepping close to poetry but never stepping into it.",
        "10. It is not good manners or clever to deprive one’s reader of the most obvious objections. It is very good manners and very clever to leave it to one’s reader alone to pronounce the ultimate quintessence of our wisdom."

      "4. Every sentence must do one of two things — reveal character or advance the action.",
      "5. Start as close to the end as possible.",
      "6. Be a Sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them-in order that the reader may see what they are made of.",
      "7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.",
      "8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

      "1. Take a pencil to write with on aeroplanes. Pens leak. But if the pencil breaks, you can’t sharpen it on the plane, because you can’t take knives with you. Therefore: take two pencils.",
      "2. If both pencils break, you can do a rough sharpening job with a nail file of the metal or glass type.",
      "3. Take something to write on. Paper is good. In a pinch, pieces of wood or your arm will do.",
      "4. If you’re using a computer, always safeguard new text with a ­memory stick.",
      "5. Do back exercises. Pain is distracting.",
      "6. Hold the reader’s attention. (This is likely to work better if you can hold your own.) But you don’t know who the reader is, so it’s like shooting fish with a slingshot in the dark. What ­fascinates A will bore the pants off B.",
      "7. You most likely need a thesaurus, a rudimentary grammar book, and a grip on reality. This latter means: there’s no free lunch. Writing is work. It’s also gambling. You don’t get a pension plan. Other people can help you a bit, but ­essentially you’re on your own. ­Nobody is making you do this: you chose it, so don’t whine.",
      "8. You can never read your own book with the innocent anticipation that comes with that first delicious page of a new book, because you wrote the thing. You’ve been backstage. You’ve seen how the rabbits were smuggled into the hat. Therefore ask a reading friend or two to look at it before you give it to anyone in the publishing business. This friend should not be someone with whom you have a ­romantic relationship, unless you want to break up.",
      "9. Don’t sit down in the middle of the woods. If you’re lost in the plot or blocked, retrace your steps to where you went wrong. Then take the other road. And/or change the person. Change the tense. Change the opening page.",
      "10. Prayer might work. Or reading ­something else. Or a constant visual­ization of the holy grail that is the finished, published version of your resplendent book.",

      "4. Put it aside. Read it pretending you’ve never read it before. Show it to friends whose opinion you respect and who like the kind of thing that this is.",
      "5. Remember: when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.",
      "6. Fix it. Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.",
      "7. Laugh at your own jokes.",
      "8. The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you’re allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it’s definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it ­honestly, and tell it as best you can. I’m not sure that there are any other rules.

      "1. First write for yourself, and then worry about the audience. \"When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story. When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.\"",
      "2. Don’t use passive voice. \“Timid writers like passive verbs for the same reason that timid lovers like passive partners. The passive voice is safe.\”",
      "3. Avoid adverbs. \“The adverb is not your friend.\"",
      "4. Avoid adverbs, especially after \“he said\” and \“she said\"",
      "5. But don’t obsess over perfect grammar. \“The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.\”",
      "6. The magic is in you. \“I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing.\”",
      "7. Read, read, read. \"If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write.\”",
      "8. Don’t worry about making other people happy. \“If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered, anyway.\"",
      "9. Turn off the TV. \“TV---while working out or anywhere else---really is about the last thing an aspiring writer needs.\”",
      "10. You have three months. “The first draft of a book---even a long one---should take no more than three months, the length of a season.”",
      "11. There are two secrets to success. “I stayed physical healthy, and I stayed married.”",
      "12. Write one word at a time. “Whether it’s a vignette of a single page or an epic trilogy like ‘The Lord of the Rings,’ the work is always accomplished one word at a time.”",
      "13. Eliminate distraction. “There’s should be no telephone in your writing room, certainly no TV or videogames for you to fool around with.”",
      "14. Stick to your own style. “One cannot imitate a writer’s approach to a particular genre, no matter how simple what that writer is doing may seem.”",
      "15. Dig. “Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible.”",
      "16. Take a break. “You’ll find reading your book over after a six-week layoff to be a strange, often exhilarating experience.”",
      "17. Leave out the boring parts and kill your darlings. “(kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings.)”",
      "18. The research shouldn’t overshadow the story. “Remember that word back. That’s where the research belongs: as far in the background and the back story as you can get it.”",
      "19. You become a writer simply by reading and writing. “You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself.”",
      "20. Writing is about getting happy. “Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid or making friends. Writing is magic, as much as the water of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink.”"
